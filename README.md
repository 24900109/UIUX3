# UI-UX-Experiment3
### Name : KIRUTHIKA.N
### Register no: 212224230127
## Aim:

The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of two leading food delivery applications—Zomato and Swiggy—using Jakob Nielsen’s heuristic principles. The objective is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare competing platforms, and recommend improvements that enhance overall usability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

## Algorithm:

### Step 1: Selection of Apps
Choose the competing applications for evaluation:

Savana 

Shein

### Step 2: Define Framework
Use Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation criteria.

### Step 3: Data Collection
Perform hands-on testing of each app.
Execute common tasks such as:

Searching for restaurants and dishes

Placing and customizing orders

Tracking live deliveries

Applying coupons and offers

Exploring subscription services (Zomato Gold, Swiggy One)

Contacting support
Record observations for each heuristic.

### Step 4: Heuristic Evaluation
Evaluate each app against the 10 heuristics.
Note usability strengths, weaknesses, and heuristic violations.

### Step 5: Comparative Analysis
Create a comparison table to analyze how each app performs.
Highlight the best performer per heuristic.

### Step 6: Problem Identification
List recurring usability issues.
Prioritize critical problems affecting user experience.

### Step 7: Recommendations
Suggest actionable design or feature improvements for each app.
Align recommendations with UX best practices.

### Step 8: Conclusion
Summarize the overall evaluation.
Identify which app delivers the strongest UX and provide improvement paths for the other.

## Output:

This is a clean, modern e-commerce website homepage displaying a new fashion collection with a large hero banner featuring a woman modelling clothing. The top navigation includes categories like Women, Men, Accessories, and Sale. A discount banner offers 10% off the first order with a promo code. On the right side, there is an Order Tracking panel showing the order status timeline (Order Placed, Packed, Shipped). Below the banner, product categories such as Tops, Dresses, and Denim are shown, followed by a grid of clothing items with images and prices.

Heuristic Evaluation: Savana vs SHEIN 

| **Heuristic**                            | **Savana**                                                                                  | **SHEIN**                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Visibility of System Status**       | Updates aren’t always clear, so users might feel unsure about what’s happening on the site. | Keeps users informed with pop-ups, real-time updates, and clear tracking indicators. |
| **2. Match Between System & Real World** | Uses simple labels, but some icons and terms don’t feel very modern or intuitive.           | Uses familiar, fashion-friendly wording and visuals that match user expectations.    |
| **3. User Control & Freedom**            | Limited options to undo actions or quickly reset selections, making navigation slower.      | Provides quick undo, easy filter resets, and smooth navigation throughout the site.  |
| **4. Consistency & Standards**           | The design is mostly consistent, but some elements still feel mismatched.                   | Follows a strong and uniform design style across all pages.                          |
| **5. Error Prevention**                  | Doesn’t offer many warnings or suggestions, so users may make avoidable mistakes.           | Gives helpful alerts, size tips, and out-of-stock messages to prevent errors.        |
| **6. Recognition Rather Than Recall**    | Users often need to search manually as there are fewer visual cues or shortcuts.            | Features clear icons, smart suggestions, and recommendations that reduce effort.     |
| **7. Flexibility & Efficiency of Use**   | Limited filtering and no personalization, which slows down repeat users.                    | Offers advanced filters, quick-buy options, favorites, and personalized suggestions. |
| **8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**     | Clean and minimal layout, but it can sometimes feel too plain or empty.                     | Visually rich and engaging, though at times slightly crowded.                        |
| **9. Error Recognition & Recovery**      | Error messages are basic and don’t always help users understand what went wrong.            | Provides clear, helpful error messages with steps to fix the issue.                  |
| **10. Help & Documentation**             | Help options are minimal and not very detailed.                                             | Offers detailed FAQs, guides, customer support, and size assistance.                 |


## Result:

The Heuristic Evaluation of Savana and Shein is created and verified.
